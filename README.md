Hello! My name is Wesley King. I'm a hobbyist computer programmer.
I started this Tetris remake using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript before having made a github account.
Unfortunately, I won't be able to have the entire history of this project on my github, but I'm resuming progress on the project, so further work will be reflected in this repository.

The project is approximately halfway done. 
So far I have added:
Responsive game board for various devices / screen sizes,
Random Piece Generation,
Collision Detection,
Partial Piece-Rotation,

Next to be added:

Full piece rotation,
All piece types generated,
scoreboard,
"Tetris" detection, as well as all pieces lowering consequently,
scoreboard
On-Screen D-Pad and buttons for mobile players
Game Over if the pieces land above the game zone

Controls (as of now):
Directional buttons to move pieces,
A Key to rotate pieces.
